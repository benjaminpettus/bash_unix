# Dive into UNIX and Bash \#196
http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/196-Dive_Into_UNIX_and_Bash.html
## Description

Learn how to navigate your UNIX system like a pro and write scripts with the popular bash scripting language. If you‚Äôd like to learn more about how to interact with your operating system and automate common tasks, this is a good goal for you.

This goal will take you through two free online books/tutorials and associated exercises:

Michael Hartl‚Äôs book ‚ÄúLearn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous‚Äù
Ryan Chadwick‚Äôs Tutorial on Bash Scripting
There are lots of exercises and activities in each of the books for you to work with. You only have to choose 20 from each book/tutorial to complete the goal. Choose the ones that most interest you and are closest to your ZPD. Some may be too easy, others too difficult.

If you‚Äôre really keen, consider doing the stretch specs.

Note: while the ‚ÄúLearn Enough Command Line‚Äù book is free to read online, you have to buy a copy in order to gain access to the official solutions. üòû However, this nice person put their solutions up, in case you‚Äôre interested in referencing.
